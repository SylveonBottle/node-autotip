## About

node-autotip is command-line based version of the Forge mod [Autotip](https://github.com/Semx11/Autotip) (by [Semx11](https://hypixel.net/members/semx11.20123), [2Pi](https://hypixel.net/members/2pi.22108) and [Sk1er](https://hypixel.net/members/sk1er.199731)).

Advantage of using node-autotip instead of the official mod is greatly smaller electricity costs, as it doesn't require any game rendering. This is achieved by communicating with the server directly using minecraft's protocol.

node-autotip also fixes the issue of "That player is not online, try another user!", making it more efficient than the original mod.
